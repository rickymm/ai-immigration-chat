## TODO

- [ ] Voice input? Does Open AI/sdk accepts this? If not at least add a voice input but don't send audio file https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/foundations/prompts#example-mp3-audio-file-from-buffer
- [ ] Configure eslint and prettier
- [ ] Add Github Actions to run tests, prettier and eslint
- [ ] Add Github rules to only merge with PR
- [ ] Deploy to vercel
- [ ] Add beautiful documentation here on README
- [ ] Receive `api-key` as parameter
- [ ] Maybe play with having multiple agents (choosing them in the Settings page)
